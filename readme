In the module block, source specifies the path to the directory containing your module (in this case, the relative path ../my-vpc-module). 
The other variables are passed to the module as input variables.


Run terraform init to download the necessary providers.

Run terraform apply to create your VPC, subnets, NAT gateway, and virtual machine.
